## Dijkstra
Dijkstra's Algorithm finds the shortest path between a given node (which is called the "source node") and all other nodes in a graph. 
* blue point: the start point
* red point: the goal point

## A-Star
The A* algorithm possesses properties of completeness, optimality, and efficiency. It guarantees finding a solution if one exists , finds the optimal path with the lowest cost , and efficiently explores fewer nodes by utilizing heuristics.
* blue point: the start point
* red point: the goal point
